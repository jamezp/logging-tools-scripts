Simple python scripts for helping with logging tools tasks.

MessageChecker: A very crude check of source files to see if there is any plain text or exceptions being thrown that
                could need i18n translations.

MessageIdGenerator: This simply updates a source file and adds id's to any line that starts with "@Message(v". If the
                    line starts with that text the next sequential line, based on the -id passed in, is added to the
                    line.
